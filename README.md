# Amazon_Toy_Recommendation_System

Recommendation systems are the most important part of an eCommerce business today as it decides the growth of business. Examples of such applications include recommending books, CDs, and other products at Amazon.com, movies at IMDB, Myntra and Flipkart. In this Project, I along with my team of 4 people, developed a recommendation system for toys on Amazon website.

Objective:

•	To develop a recommendation system for kid’s toy products for Amazon using different Machine Learning techniques.

•	Recommending products based on association rule mining (For example: “The following items are bought together”) and clustering (For example: “if you bought this...you might want this” or “similar products”).

•	Recommendation system was build using different parameters like Price of the product, Rating of Product, Type of product, Brand of product.


Data Preparation:

•	Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/toy-products-on-amazon

•	Web scaping was further done to obtain other attributes corresponding to different products listed in the above dataset.

Methods:

•	Different machine learning algorithms have been implemented including:

o	DBSCAN

o	K-median clustering

o	Apriori Algorithm
